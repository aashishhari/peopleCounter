# Welcome to Team3's Project Repo for EECS 300

 In this repo, you'll find our final project code within the `finalDemo` folder.
 
 > `EECS300pcb` contains all the parts of the Eagle PCB Project (schematic, pcb view, gerber, drill, etc.).
 
 > `GerberFiles` contains gerber and drill files sent to JLCPCB for final PCB production.

 Additionally, a couple extra files and directories contain a few different implementations we were experiment with throughout the process.
