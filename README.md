# Welcome to Team3's Project Repo for EECS 300

 __In this repo, you'll find our final project code within the `finalDemo` folder.  Note the requirements below.__
 
 > `EECS300pcb` contains all the parts of the Eagle PCB Project (schematic, pcb view, gerber, drill, etc.).
 
 > `GerberFiles` contains gerber and drill files sent to JLCPCB for final PCB production.
 
 > `TestingData` contains the testing data referenced in our final report.

 Additionally, a couple extra files and directories contain a few different implementations we were experimenting with throughout the process.  
 
 PCB.jpg includes a picture of our final PCB design.


__Required Libraries/Dependencies (These need to be installed to run):__
 1. SparkFun_VL53L1X *Version 1.2.9*
 2. Arduino Development Environment (with arduino-esp32 core from Espressif)
